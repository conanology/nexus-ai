# Product Brief: NEXUS-AI

## Executive Summary

NEXUS-AI is a fully autonomous YouTube channel delivering daily AI and technology news to time-constrained professionals and enthusiasts. By combining intelligent news curation, programmatic visual generation, and precision voice synthesis, NEXUS-AI solves the "AI news firehose problem" - the reality that keeping up with AI developments has become a full-time job for people who already have full-time jobs.

The channel targets professionals (developers, PMs, founders), tech enthusiasts, and business leaders who need to stay current on AI developments but lack the time to monitor fragmented sources across Twitter, arXiv, GitHub, and dozens of newsletters. NEXUS-AI delivers a curated 5-8 minute daily briefing that respects viewers' time while ensuring they never miss developments that could impact their work.

**Revenue Target:** $3,000+/month within 6 months through AdSense, affiliate partnerships, and sponsorships.

**Key Innovation:** Full automation pipeline from news sourcing to published video, enabling consistent daily output without creator burnout.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

The pace of AI development has outstripped human capacity to track it. New models, tools, papers, and startups emerge almost daily across fragmented platforms - Twitter, Hacker News, arXiv, GitHub, HuggingFace, and company blogs. No single source provides consistent, daily, well-produced coverage. Human creators either burn out or miss important developments, leaving their audiences underserved.

### Problem Impact

- **Professionals** discover critical tools months late when competitors already use them
- **Tech enthusiasts** resort to doom-scrolling Twitter, hoping algorithms surface important news
- **Business leaders** lose credibility when they're uninformed about developments affecting their industry
- **Everyone** wastes time on outdated approaches because they missed the paper or tool that solved their problem

The cost of being uninformed in AI is measured in missed opportunities, wasted effort, and eroded professional credibility.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Solution | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| **Newsletters** (5+ required) | Fragmented; requires synthesis across sources |
| **Twitter/X** | Algorithm-dependent; encourages doom-scrolling; hype-heavy |
| **YouTube channels** | Inconsistent posting; robotic voices; stock footage filler |
| **World of AI** (benchmark) | Pronunciation errors; generic visuals; no curation prioritization |

Current AI news channels have proven audience demand exists but fail on execution: mispronounced names destroy credibility, stock footage adds no value, and inconsistent posting trains audiences to disengage.

### Proposed Solution

NEXUS-AI delivers a daily 5-8 minute video covering the 3-5 AI developments that matter most, every single day, with:

- **Intelligent Curation:** Freshness scoring algorithm prioritizes news by virality, source authority, and recency
- **Credible Voice:** Pronunciation dictionary ensures proper nouns and technical terms are spoken correctly
- **Original Visuals:** Programmatic animations (Remotion + Manim) explain concepts instead of generic B-roll
- **Full Automation:** End-to-end pipeline from source scraping to published video eliminates creator burnout
- **Consistent Quality:** Automation guarantees a quality floor; human-in-the-loop for edge cases only

The core promise: *"Watch NEXUS-AI for 6 minutes a day and you'll know more about AI than 95% of tech professionals."*

### Key Differentiators

1. **Pronunciation Moat** - Living dictionary with IPA phonemes for proper nouns, acronyms, and technical terms. Saying "Yann LeCun" and "Mixtral" correctly builds trust that competitors erode.

2. **Visual Intelligence** - No stock footage. Animated component library (neural networks, data flows, comparisons, metrics) creates a distinctive visual language that aids comprehension.

3. **Freshness Algorithm** - News ranked by `(virality_velocity × source_authority) / hours_since_break` ensures coverage of what matters, not just what's easy.

4. **Full Automation Architecture** - Source scraping, script generation, visual assembly, TTS, upload, thumbnails, and SEO run autonomously. Human intervention only for strategic decisions and crisis response.

5. **Consistent Daily Output** - Automation eliminates the burnout cycle that plagues human creators. Viewers can rely on NEXUS-AI appearing in their feed every single day.
